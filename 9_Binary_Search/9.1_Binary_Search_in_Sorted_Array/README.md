# Binary Search in Sorted Array
**Topic:** Binary Search

**Type:** In-Session

Problem :

 Given a sorted array of integers nums and an integer target, return the index of target in nums. If target is not found, return -1. 

Input Explanation: 

nums: A list of integers sorted in ascending order. 

target: Integer value to search for. 

Output Explanation: 

Integer index of target in nums if present; otherwise, -1. 

Examples: 
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], target = 3 
Output: 2 
Explanation: 3 is found at index 2 in the array. 

Input: nums = [-10,-3,0,4,8,12], target = 4 
Output: 3 
Explanation: 4 is found at index 3. 
 

Input: nums = [2,4,5,7,10], target = 6 
Output: -1 
Explanation: 6 is not present in the array.
