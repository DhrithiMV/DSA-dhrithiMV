# Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
**Topic:** Binary Search

**Type:** In-Session


Problem :

 Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value. If target is not found, return [-1, -1]. 

Input Explanation: 

nums: List of integers sorted in ascending order. 

target: Integer value whose start and end positions are to be found. 

Output Explanation: 

List of two integers: [first_index, last_index] indicating the start and end positions of target; [-1, -1] if not present. 

Examples: 

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8 
Output: [3,4] 
Explanation: 8 appears from index 3 to 4. 
 

Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,2,3,4], target = 2 
Output: [2,4] 
Explanation: 2 is found from index 2 to 4. 
 

Input: nums = [1,3,3,3,4,5], target = 6 
Output: [-1,-1] 
Explanation: 6 is not present in the array.
