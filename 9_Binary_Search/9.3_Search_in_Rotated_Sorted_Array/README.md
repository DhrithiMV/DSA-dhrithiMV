# Search in Rotated Sorted Array
**Topic:** Binary Search

**Type:** Home Challenge

Problem :

 Suppose a sorted array is rotated at an unknown pivot index. Given the rotated array nums and an integer target, return the index of target if found; otherwise, return -1. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity. 

Input Explanation: 

nums: List of integers, originally sorted in ascending order, rotated at some unknown pivot. 

target: Integer value to search for. 

Output Explanation: 

Integer index of target in nums if present; otherwise, -1. 

Examples: 

 

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0 
Output: 4 
Explanation: 0 is found at index 4 after rotation. 
 

Input: nums = [6,7,8,1,2,3,4,5], target = 8 
Output: 2 
Explanation: 8 is at index 2. 
 

Input: nums = [7,8,1,2,3,4,5,6], target = 5 
Output: 6 
Explanation: 5 is at index 6.
