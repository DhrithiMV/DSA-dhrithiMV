# Contains Duplicate II
**Topic:** Hashtables

**Type:** Home Challenge

Problem :


Given an integer array nums and an integer k, determine if there exist two distinct indices i and j such that nums[i] == nums[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k. 

Return True if such a pair exists; otherwise, return False. 

This problem adds a constraint related to the closeness of duplicate elements, requiring careful handling of indices. 

Examples 

Input: nums = [1][2][3][1], k = 3 

Output: True 

Explanation: The duplicates 1 are at indices 0 and 3, with difference exactly 3. 

Input: nums = [1][0][1][1], k = 1 

Output: True 

Explanation: The duplicates 1 appear at indices 2 and 3, difference is 1. 

Input: nums = [1][2][3][1][2][3], k = 2 

Output: False 

Explanation: Though duplicates exist, no pairs have indices closer or equal to 2. 

Input: nums = [], k = 0 

Output: False 

Explanation: Empty array has no duplicates.
