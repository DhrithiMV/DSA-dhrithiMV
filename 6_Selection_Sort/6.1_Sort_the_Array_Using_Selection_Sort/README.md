Problem: Sort the Array Using Selection Sort 

You are given an integer array nums. 

 Your task is to sort the array in non-decreasing order using the Selection Sort algorithm. 

Selection Sort works as follows: 

For each index i from 0 to n-1: 

Find the minimum element in the subarray [i â€¦ n-1]. 

Swap it with the element at index i. 

Continue until the array is sorted. 

You must not use any built-in sort functions. 

 

Example 1 

Input: nums = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11] 
Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64] 
Explanation:  
- First pass: [11, 25, 12, 22, 64] 
- Second pass: [11, 12, 25, 22, 64] 
- Third pass: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64] 
- Fourth pass: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64] (no swap needed) 
  

Example 2 

Input: nums = [5, 1, 4, 2, 8] 
Output: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8] 

Constraints 

1 <= nums.length <= 1000 

-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4 

Follow-up 

What is the time complexity of selection sort in the worst case? 

Is selection sort stable? Why or why not?
