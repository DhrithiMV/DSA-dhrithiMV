# Minimum Swaps Using Selection Sort
**Topic:** Selection Sort

**Type:** Home Challenge

Problem :

Problem: Count the Number of Swaps 

You are given an integer array nums. 

 Sort the array in non-decreasing order using Selection Sort, and return the number of swaps performed during the process. 

⚠️ Important: A swap happens only if the minimum element is different from the current position. 

 

Example 1 

Input: nums = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11] 
Output: 3 
Explanation: 
- First swap: [11, 25, 12, 22, 64] 
- Second swap: [11, 12, 25, 22, 64] 
- Third swap: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64] 
Total swaps = 3 
  

Example 2 

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4] 
Output: 0 
Explanation: 
Already sorted, so no swaps are needed. 
  

 

Constraints 

1 <= nums.length <= 2000 

-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5 

Follow-up 

Can you prove that Selection Sort always performs at most n-1 swaps? 

Why might Selection Sort be preferred in situations where swaps are expensive, even though it’s O(n^2)?
