# Sort a Linked List
**Topic:** Merge Sort

**Type:** Home Challenge

Problem :

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the list after sorting it in ascending order. 

 You must use Merge Sort because of the linked list constraints (no random access). 


 Example 

Input: 

head = [4, 2, 1, 3] 
  

Output: 

[1, 2, 3, 4] 
  

 

Constraints 

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 10^4]. 

-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
