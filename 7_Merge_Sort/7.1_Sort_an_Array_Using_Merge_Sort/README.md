# Sort an Array Using Merge Sort
**Topic:** Merge Sort

**Type:** In-Session

Problem :

Implement the Merge Sort algorithm to sort an integer array. 

You are not allowed to use built-in sorting functions. You must implement merge and recursive division logic yourself. 


Example 

Input: 

arr = [5, 2, 3, 1] 
  

Output: 
 
[1, 2, 3, 5] 
  

Constraints 

1 <= arr.length <= 10^5 

-10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
