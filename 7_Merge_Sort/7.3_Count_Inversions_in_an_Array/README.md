# Count Inversions in an Array
**Topic:** Merge Sort

**Type:** Home Challenge

Problem :

An inversion in an array is a pair of indices (i, j) such that: 

i < j and 

arr[i] > arr[j]. 

You need to count the total number of inversions in the given array. 

 Solve this problem using Merge Sort in O(n log n) time. 


 Example 1 

Input: 

arr = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5] 
  

Output: 
 
3 
  

Explanation: 

 Inversions are (2,1), (4,1), (4,3) â†’ total 3. 

 

Example 2 

Input: 

arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] 
  

Output: 

10 
  

Explanation: Every pair is inverted. 

 

Constraints 

1 <= arr.length <= 10^5 

-10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
