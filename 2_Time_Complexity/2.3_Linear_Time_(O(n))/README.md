Sum of Array Elements 

Statement: Given an array, find the sum of its elements. 

Constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, -10^3 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^3 

Time Complexity: O(n) 

Space Complexity: O(1) 

Test Cases: 

Input: [2,4,6,8] → Output: 20 

Input: [1] → Output: 1 

Input: [-5,10,-3] → Output: 2 

Input: [0,0,0,0] → Output: 0
