# Subarray with Sum Closest to Target
**Topic:** Lists with Two Pointer Techniques

**Type:** Home Challenge

Problem :

 Given a sorted list of integers nums (can contain negative numbers) and an integer target, find a pair of numbers whose sum is closest to the target. Return their 0-based indices as a list. If multiple pairs have the same difference, return the pair with the smallest first index. 

Input Explanation: 

nums: Sorted list of integers. 

target: Target sum integer. 

Output Explanation: 

List of two integers (0-based indices of closest-sum pair). 

Examples: 

Input: nums = [-7, -3, 2, 5, 10], target = 6 
Output: [2,3] 
Explanation: 2 + 5 = 7, which is closest to 6. 

 

Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 8, 12], target = 16 
Output: [3,4] 
Explanation: 8 + 12 = 20, difference is 4; 3 + 12 = 15, difference is 1, so 5 + 12 (17, diff 1) is also close, but 3,4 is smallest first index. 

 

Input: nums = [-10, -5, -2, 1], target = -9 
Output: [0,2] 
Explanation: -10 + -2 = -12 (diff 3), -10 + 1 = -9 (diff 0), so [0,3] is correct.
