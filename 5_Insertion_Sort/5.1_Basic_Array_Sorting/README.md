Easy: Basic Array Sorting 

Sort an Array Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order using insertion sort and return it. 

Start with the first element as the sorted portion. 

For each subsequent element, insert it into its correct position in the sorted portion by shifting larger elements right. This is a foundational problem for mastering insertion sort’s loop invariants and array shifts, akin to sorting small datasets in a Django API endpoint. Constraints: 

1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 5 × 10^4 

-10^9 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9 Example: 

Input: nums = [5,2,3,1] 

Output: [1,2,3,5] Why It Fits: Pure insertion sort on arrays, ideal for practicing iterative shifts and understanding best-case (O(n) for nearly sorted) vs. worst-case (O(n²)) performance.
