# Count Substrings with Exactly K Distinct Characters
**Topic:** Strings with Two Pointer Technique

**Type:** In-Session

Problem :

 Given a string s and an integer k, find the number of substrings that contain exactly k distinct characters. Use a two-pointer sliding window technique to efficiently count such substrings. 

Example: 
 Input: s = "pqpqs", k = 2 
 Output: 7 
 Explanation: The substrings with exactly 2 distinct characters are: "pq", "pqp", "qp", "qpq", "pq", "qs", "s". 

Constraints: 
 1 ≤ s.length ≤ 10^5 
 s consists of lowercase English letters. 
 1 ≤ k ≤ 26
