# Longest Palindromic Substring using Manacher's Algorithm
**Topic:** Strings with Two Pointer Technique

**Type:** Home Challenge

Problem :

 Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring. Due to the large constraints, implement Manacher’s Algorithm which runs in linear time O(n), instead of the naive two-pointer expansion approach. 

Example: 
 Input: "abacdfgdcaba" 
 Output: "aba" (Multiple valid outputs possible) 

Input: "bananas" 
 Output: "anana" 

Constraints: 

1≤s.length≤106 

s consists of ASCII characters.
