# Check Interleaving of Two Strings with Overlapping Patterns
**Topic:** Strings with Two Pointer Technique

**Type:** Home Challenge

Problem :

 Given three strings s1, s2, and s3, check if s3 is formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2. Characters in s1 and s2 can appear multiple times, and overlapping repeated patterns should be managed using an optimized two-pointer strategy. Input lengths may be large, demanding linear or near-linear time complexity. 

Example: 
 Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac" 
 Output: true 

Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc" 
 Output: false 

Constraints: 

1≤s1.length,s2.length≤105 

s3.length=s1.length+s2.length
